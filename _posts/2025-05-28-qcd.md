## Contrastive Decoding (CD) and the Role of the Amateur Model

### 1. What is Contrastive Decoding (CD)?

    Contrastive decoding exploits the contrasts between expert and amateur LM of different sizes by choosing tokens that maximize their log-likelihood difference. CD produces high-quality text that amplifies the good expert behavior and diminishes the undesired amateur behavior.
</div>

Contrastive Decoding (CD) is a novel decoding method proposed to improve the quality of text generation in large language models (LLMs). Traditional decoding strategies like greedy decoding select the highest-probability token at each step, which can result in highly degenerate behavior such as repetitive or overly concise text. On the other hand, probabilistic sampling (e.g., temperature sampling, top-k, or nucleus sampling) introduces randomness to improve diversity, but often at the cost of coherence and relevance. CD aims to combine the strengths of both while avoiding their weaknesses by leveraging two language models and optimizing a contrastive objective.

- Greedy decoding tends to produce repetitive and overly simple outputs by always selecting the highest-probability token.
- Sampling-based decoding introduces diversity by adding randomness but can result in incoherent or off-topic responses.
- Contrastive Decoding uses a large expert model and a smaller amateur model. It selects tokens that are favored by the expert model but not by the amateur model. This amplifies the expert's strengths while suppressing undesirable patterns learned by the weaker model.

The core idea behind CD is to exploit the difference in token likelihoods predicted by the two models. The score for a candidate token  is calculated as:

$$ \text{Score}(x) = \log P_{\text{expert}}(x \mid \text{context}) - \lambda \log P_{\text{amateur}}(x \mid \text{context}) $$

Here, $P_{\text{expert}}$ is the probability from the expert model, $P_{\text{amateur}}$ is from the amateur model, and  $\lambda$ is a balancing factor (often set to 1). This scoring mechanism favors tokens that are highly likely under the expert but unlikely under the amateur, indicating fluency and novelty.

To prevent pathological cases (e.g., selecting implausible or noisy tokens), a plausibility constraint is applied. That is, only tokens whose expert likelihood exceeds a certain threshold are considered:

$$ x \in \{ w \in \mathcal{V} \mid P_{\text{expert}}(w \mid \text{context}) \geq \alpha \cdot \max_{w'} P_{\text{expert}}(w' \mid \text{context}) \} $$

This ensures grammatical and contextual coherence.

Later studies shows that Contrastive Decoding not only improves generation quality but enhances reasoning ability. For example, O'Brien & Lewis (2023) demonstrated that CD-enhanced LLaMA-65B outperformed larger models like GPT-3.5 and PaLM 2 on benchmarks such as HellaSwag and GSM8K. CD discourages superficial answers by penalizing shallow or obvious completions preferred by smaller models, encouraging deeper inference paths.

### 2. Dependence on a Smaller "Amateur" Model
Contrastive Decoding relies fundamentally on having two different LMs: a strong expert and a weaker amateur. If we attempted to use the same model for both roles, the contrastive objective would trivially cancel out (since $\log P_{\rm expert}(w)=\log P_{\rm amateur}(w)$ for every token $w$).  Concretely, the CD score for a sequence $\mathbf{x}$ is
$$S(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{t=1}^T\Bigl[\log P_{\rm expert}(x_t \mid x_{<t}) - \log P_{\rm amateur}(x_t \mid x_{<t})\Bigr].$$
If $P_{\rm expert}=P_{\rm amateur}$, then $S(\mathbf{x})=0$ for all $\mathbf{x}$, yielding no preference among continuations ￼.  More importantly, however, the need for a separate amateur model goes beyond this triviality: a distinct, weaker model produces a systematically different probability distribution that highlights undesirable patterns.

In practice, a small language model (the amateur) tends to place much higher probability on degenerate tokens (e.g. repetitions or off-topic phrases) than the expert does.  Indeed, “many failure modes of language models (short, repetitive, irrelevant or uninteresting strings) are more common under smaller LMs than under larger LMs”.  For example, if both models consider repeating the same noun (“Hawaii Hawaii …”), the small model will usually be overconfident in that repetition, while the large model assigns some probability to other alternatives.  In terms of the contrastive score, such a token $w$ has $\log P_{\rm amateur}(w)\gg \log P_{\rm expert}(w)$, so $S$ becomes strongly negative, effectively penalizing $w$.  In this way the amateur’s “mistakes” serve as negative signals: tokens it favors are deemed undesirable and are downweighted in generation. Conversely, desirable continuations that the expert favors (e.g. factual or novel content) but that the amateur underestimates will receive a higher contrastive score.

Mathematically, one can view the contrast as emphasizing the ratio $P_{\rm expert}/P_{\rm amateur}$.  When the two distributions diverge on certain tokens, the contrastive term $\log\frac{P_{\rm expert}(w)}{P_{\rm amateur}(w)}$ will be large (positive or negative) and guide selection.  If the distributions are nearly identical, there is no such guidance.  Crucially, we want the amateur’s distribution to differ in exactly the right ways: it should magnify the expert’s failure modes.  Empirically, pairing a large expert with a much smaller amateur (e.g.\ OPT-13B expert with OPT-125M amateur) yields much higher-quality text.  By contrast, using an identical model produces highly repetitive outputs because no contrast can be exploited. Even using a stronger amateur than expert  or a trivial model (like a 3-gram LM) fails: the former flips the desired direction, and the latter makes errors that do not align with the expert’s weaknesses.

In summary, a separate weaker model is essential not only to avoid the obvious cancelation of the contrastive term, but more importantly to induce a distributional gap.  The amateur’s sharper biases toward repetition and incoherence highlight those patterns as negative examples.  Contrastive Decoding then effectively “filters out” any token that the amateur model overvalues ￼ ￼, leaving the fluent, coherent continuations that the large expert model uniquely prefers.  This asymmetric design — expert versus a weaker, differently trained model — is what makes the contrastive objective meaningful and powerful in practi

## Workarounds When No Amateur Model Is Available

In practice, we may not always have a smaller “amateur” model on hand for contrastive decoding. One notable approach is Induce-then-Contrast Decoding (ICD) (Yue Zhang et al, 2024), which turns the original LLM into both the expert and the amateur in a two-phase process . The idea is to induce the big model to produce hallucinations (thereby acting like a factually deficient model) and then contrast those hallucinated outputs against the normal model’s outputs. This effectively penalizes content that looks like the model’s known hallucinations, guiding the decoder towards more truthful results.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Illustration of our induce-then-contrast decoding (ICD) method for reducing hallucinations in LLMs.
</div>


**How does the model hallucinate on purpose?** 

The authors of ICD construct a *factuality-weak* version of the LLM – essentially an “evil twin” that has a higher tendency to fabricate information. One of the methods the authors chose was to **create an “evil-twin” model by fine-tuning the original LLM on False Dataset**. For the strongest effect, one can fine-tune a copy of the model on a small, synthetic dataset of factual errors. In the ICD paper, the authors automatically generated non-factual Q&A examples (e.g. altering a correct fact “ACL 2024 will be held in Bangkok” into a false version “ACL 2024 will be held in Singapore”) and fine-tuned the LLM on these hallucination-style responses . This “hallucination-happy” model serves as a robust amateur that consistently produces fluent yet incorrect outputs. 

Once we have the original model and an induced-hallucination version with fine-tuning, we perform **contrastive decoding between them at each step**. This contrastive re-weighting steers the final choice away from content the model’s “weak alter-ego” would say, thereby filtering out potential fabrications without needing an external smaller network.

Crucially, this induced contrast method maintains the benefits of using a powerful LLM while creating an internal check against its own flaws. The results reported for ICD are impressive: across multiple benchmarks, **a single 7B model using ICD can match or even surpass the factuality of models that are 10× larger** .This highlights that a carefully induced “amateur” can be far more informative than a generic smaller model. The contrast signal is directly tuned to the kinds of mistakes the expert would otherwise make, so it catches factual errors that might slip past an unrelated weaker model.

**Limitations**

While this induce-and-contrast method can markedly improve factual accuracy, it carries **substantial overhead on two fronts**. First, inference now needs **two forward passes** instead of one, roughly doubling per-token compute (the authors report ≈1.6 × latency). **Second—and often more costly—you must actually create the hallucination-prone “evil-twin” model via a separate fine-tuning step.** Even with lightweight adapters such as LoRA, this demands extra GPU hours, synthetic data generation, additional checkpoints to store, and a parallel deployment path to maintain. In short, Induce-then-Contrast is a powerful stop-gap when no pre-trained amateur model exists—it lets you bake one from scratch—but it is **anything but a free lunch** in engineering effort, training time, and runtime cost.


## Quantization of LLMs

Before diving into main section of this blog post, let’s briefly recap model quantization. **Quantization** means compressing a neural network by using fewer bits to represent weights (and sometimes activations), thereby drastically reducing memory and speeding up inference . Modern LLMs often use 16-bit or 32-bit floats; quantization can shrink them to 8-bit or even 4-bit integers. The big question is: *how does quantization affect an LLM’s performance, especially on reasoning tasks?* Recent empirical studies have started to answer this. 

**Liu et al. (2025)** conducted a comprehensive study titled *“Quantization Hurts Reasoning? An Empirical Study on Quantized Reasoning Models.”* They found that moderate quantization can preserve accuracy, but **aggressive low-bit quantization does degrade reasoning performance** . In particular, using 8-bit weights (or a 4-bit weight with 16-bit activations, denoted W8A8 or W4A16) was nearly *lossless* on a variety of math, science, and coding benchmarks . However, pushing to 4-bit or 3-bit weights across the board introduced significant accuracy drops on these reasoning-heavy tasks . This suggests that **reasoning LLMs are somewhat fragile to quantization.**


## Quantization Contrastive Decoding
Traditional contrastive decoding is powerful, but it hinges on having a weaker partner model. When an off-the-shelf “small sibling” isn’t available, we can manufacture one on the fly by **quantizing the expert itself**. Dropping the weights to 4-bit precision (or even 3-bit in extreme cases) reliably erodes a model’s reasoning ability while leaving its vocabulary and tensor shapes untouched—perfect for the contrastive objective.

As I mentioned in previous section, recent studies have measured this effect in detail: an 8-bit model stays almost on par with its full-precision parent, but 4-bit variants start to miss multi-step inferences, struggle with long-range dependencies, and hallucinate more factual errors. In other words, quantization delivers exactly the sort of “predictable clumsiness” we want from an amateur. Better yet, it costs only a few minutes of post-processing and zero additional training.

With **QCD**, we therefore get a complete contrastive pair from a single checkpoint:

1. **Expert** – the original, full-precision network.
2. **Amateur** – a weight-quantized clone that shares the same logits but makes poorer choices.

Because both networks live inside the same model family by construction, we sidestep vocabulary-mismatch headaches, avoid extra training for a second model. In practice this means: *take one model, quantize a copy, run two forward passes, apply contrastive scoring—done.* It’s a lightweight recipe that brings CD’s fluency-and-reasoning gains to any standalone model, without waiting for someone to release a matching “tiny” version.

그래서 보면 bit quantization 을 해도, 그룹사이즈가 너무 낮아지면 애가 너무 똑똑해져서 원래 logits 랑 별차이가 없음 or 오히려 CD에서 이득이 전혀 없는 애로 만드어짐. 그래서 적당히 멍청한 모델을 만들려면 2bit 에서 group 64 or 32 정도가 적당한 것 같다.
