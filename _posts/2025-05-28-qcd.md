## Contrastive Decoding (CD) and the Role of the Amateur Model

### 1. What is Contrastive Decoding (CD)?

</div>

Contrastive Decoding (CD) <d-cite key="CD"></d-cite> is a novel decoding method proposed to improve the quality of text generation in large language models (LLMs). Traditional decoding strategies like greedy decoding select the highest-probability token at each step, which can result in highly degenerate behavior such as repetitive or overly concise text. On the other hand, probabilistic sampling (e.g., temperature sampling, top-k, or nucleus sampling) introduces randomness to improve diversity, but often at the cost of coherence and relevance. CD aims to combine the strengths of both while avoiding their weaknesses by leveraging two language models and optimizing a contrastive objective.

- Greedy decoding tends to produce repetitive and overly simple outputs by always selecting the highest-probability token.
- Sampling-based decoding introduces diversity by adding randomness but can result in incoherent or off-topic responses.
- Contrastive Decoding uses a large expert model and a smaller amateur model. It selects tokens that are favored by the expert model but not by the amateur model. This amplifies the expert's strengths while suppressing undesirable patterns learned by the weaker model.

The core idea behind CD is to exploit the difference in token likelihoods predicted by the two models. The score for a candidate token  is calculated as:

$$ \text{Score}(x) = \log P_{\text{expert}}(x \mid \text{context}) - \lambda \log P_{\text{amateur}}(x \mid \text{context}) $$

Here, $P_{\text{expert}}$ is the probability from the expert model, $P_{\text{amateur}}$ is from the amateur model, and  $\lambda$ is a CD temeperature that balances the penalization from the amateur model. This scoring mechanism favors tokens that are highly likely under the expert but unlikely under the amateur, indicating fluency and novelty.

To prevent pathological cases (e.g., selecting implausible or noisy tokens), a plausibility constraint is applied. That is, only tokens whose expert likelihood exceeds a certain threshold are considered:

$$ x \in \{ w \in \mathcal{V} \mid P_{\text{expert}}(w \mid \text{context}) \geq \alpha \cdot \max_{w'} P_{\text{expert}}(w' \mid \text{context}) \} $$

This ensures grammatical and contextual coherence.

The authors highlighted the following advanteage:
1.	**Mitigation of Degenerate Outputs**:  
  Traditional greedy decoding often results in repetitive or overly simplistic text, while sampling-based methods can produce incoherent outputs. CD effectively balances these issues by selecting tokens that are probable under the expert model but not under the amateur model, leading to more coherent and diverse text generation.
2.	**Training-Free Implementation:**  
  CD operates without the need for additional training. It utilizes pre-existing models to compute the contrastive objective, making it computationally efficient and easy to integrate into existing systems.
3.	**Enhanced Performance Across Tasks**:   
  Empirical evaluations demonstrated that CD outperforms both greedy and sampling-based decoding methods across various benchmarks, including Wikipedia, news articles, and storytelling tasks. This indicates its robustness and versatility in different text generation scenarios.
4.	**Scalability Across Model Sizes**:  
  The method is effective across different scales of language models, from smaller models like GPT-2 to larger ones like OPT-13B. This scalability ensures that CD can be applied broadly, regardless of the underlying model size.

Later studies shows that Contrastive Decoding not only improves generation quality but enhances reasoning ability. For example, O'Brien & Lewis (2023)<d-cite key="CDReasoning"></d-cite> demonstrated that CD-enhanced LLaMA-65B outperformed larger models like GPT-3.5 and PaLM 2 on benchmarks such as HellaSwag and GSM8K. CD discourages superficial answers by penalizing shallow or obvious completions preferred by smaller models, encouraging deeper inference paths.

### 2. Dependence on a Smaller "Amateur" Model
Contrastive Decoding relies fundamentally on having two different LMs:  
**a strong expert** and **a weaker amateur**.  
If we attempted to use the same model for both roles, the contrastive objective would trivially cancel out (since $\log P_{\rm expert}(w)=\log P_{\rm amateur}(w)$ for every token $w$).   
Concretely, the CD score for a sequence $\mathbf{x}$ is

$$
S(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{t=1}^T \left[ \log P_{\mathrm{expert}}(x_t \mid x_{\lt t}) - \lambda \log P_{\mathrm{amateur}}(x_t \mid x_{\lt t}) \right]
$$

If $P_{\rm expert}=P_{\rm amateur}$, then $S(\mathbf{x})=(1-\lambda)\sum_{t=1}^T\Bigl[\log P_{\rm expert}(x_t \mid x_{\lt t})\Bigl]=(1-\lambda)\sum_{t=1}^T\Bigl[\log P_{\rm amateur}(x_t \mid x_{\lt t}) \Bigr]$ for all $\mathbf{x}$, which is same with greedy decoding.  More importantly, however, the need for a separate amateur model goes beyond this triviality: **a distinct, weaker model produces a systematically different probability distribution that highlights undesirable patterns.**

In practice, a small language model (the amateur) tends to place much higher probability on degenerate tokens (e.g. repetitions or off-topic phrases) than the expert does.  Indeed, **“many failure modes of language models (short, repetitive, irrelevant or uninteresting strings) are more common under smaller LMs than under larger LMs”.**  For example, if both models consider repeating the same noun (“Hawaii Hawaii …”), the small model will usually be overconfident in that repetition, while the large model assigns some probability to other alternatives.  In terms of the contrastive score, such a token $w$ has $\log P_{\rm amateur}(w)\gg \log P_{\rm expert}(w)$, so $S$ becomes strongly negative, effectively penalizing $w$.  In this way the amateur’s “mistakes” serve as negative signals: tokens it favors are deemed undesirable and are downweighted in generation. Conversely, desirable continuations that the expert favors (e.g. factual or novel content) but that the amateur underestimates will receive a higher contrastive score.

Mathematically, one can view the contrast as emphasizing the ratio $P_{\rm expert}/P_{\rm amateur}$.  When the two distributions diverge on certain tokens, the contrastive term $\log\frac{P_{\rm expert}(w)}{P_{\rm amateur}(w)}$ will be large (positive or negative) and guide selection.  If the distributions are nearly identical, there is no such guidance.  Crucially, we want the amateur’s distribution to differ in exactly the right ways: it should magnify the expert’s failure modes.  Empirically, pairing a large expert with a much smaller amateur (e.g.\ OPT-13B expert with OPT-125M amateur) yields much higher-quality text.  By contrast, using an identical model produces highly repetitive outputs because no contrast can be exploited. Even using a stronger amateur than expert  or a trivial model (like a 3-gram LM) fails: the former flips the desired direction, and the latter makes errors that do not align with the expert’s weaknesses.

In summary, a separate weaker model is essential not only to avoid the obvious cancelation of the contrastive term, but more importantly to induce a distributional gap.  The amateur’s sharper biases toward repetition and incoherence highlight those patterns as negative examples.  Contrastive Decoding then effectively “filters out” any token that the amateur model overvalues, leaving the fluent, coherent continuations that the large expert model uniquely prefers.  This asymmetric design — expert versus a weaker, differently trained model — is what makes the contrastive objective meaningful and powerful in practie.

## Workarounds When No Amateur Model Is Available

In practice, we may not always have a smaller “amateur” model on hand for contrastive decoding. One notable approach is Induce-then-Contrast Decoding (ICD)<d-cite key="ICD"></d-cite>,which turns the original LLM into both the expert and the amateur in a two-phase process . The idea is to induce the big model to produce hallucinations (thereby acting like a factually deficient model) and then contrast those hallucinated outputs against the normal model’s outputs. This effectively penalizes content that looks like the model’s known hallucinations, guiding the decoder towards more truthful results.

</div>


**How does the model hallucinate on purpose?** 

The authors of ICD construct a *factuality-weak* version of the LLM – essentially an “evil twin” that has a higher tendency to fabricate information. One of the methods the authors chose was to **create an “evil-twin” model by fine-tuning the original LLM on False Dataset**. For the strongest effect, one can fine-tune a copy of the model on a small, synthetic dataset of factual errors. In the ICD paper, the authors automatically generated non-factual QA examples (e.g. altering a correct fact “ACL 2024 will be held in Bangkok” into a false version “ACL 2024 will be held in Singapore”) and fine-tuned the LLM on these hallucination-style responses . This induced-hallucination model serves as a robust amateur that consistently produces fluent yet incorrect outputs. 

Once we have the original model and an induced-hallucination version with fine-tuning, we perform **contrastive decoding between them at each step**. This contrastive re-weighting steers the final choice away from content the model’s “weak alter-ego” would say, thereby filtering out potential fabrications without needing an external smaller network.

Crucially, this induced contrast method maintains the benefits of using a powerful LLM while creating an internal check against its own flaws. The results reported for ICD are impressive: across multiple benchmarks, **a single 7B model using ICD can match or even surpass the factuality of models that are 10× larger**. This highlights that a carefully induced amateur can be far more informative than a generic smaller model. The contrast signal is directly tuned to the kinds of mistakes the expert would otherwise make, so it catches factual errors that might slip past an unrelated weaker model.

**Limitations**

While this induce-and-contrast method can markedly improve factual accuracy, it carries **substantial overhead on two fronts**. First, inference now needs **two forward passes** instead of one, roughly doubling per-token compute (the authors report ≈1.6 × latency). The most important and crucial limitation of ICD is **that you must actually create the hallucination-prone “evil-twin” model via a separate fine-tuning step.** Even with lightweight adapters such as LoRA, this demands extra GPU hours, synthetic data generation, additional checkpoints to store, and a parallel deployment path to maintain. In short, Induce-then-Contrast is a powerful stop-gap when no pre-trained amateur model exists—it lets you bake one from scratch—but it is **anything but a free lunch** in engineering effort, training time, and runtime cost.


## Quantization of LLMs

Before diving into main section of this blog post, let’s briefly recap model quantization. **Quantization** means compressing a neural network by using fewer bits to represent weights (and sometimes activations), thereby drastically reducing memory and speeding up inference . Modern LLMs often use 16-bit or 32-bit floats; quantization can shrink them to 8-bit or even 4-bit integers. The big question is: *how does quantization affect an LLM’s performance, especially on reasoning tasks?* Recent empirical studies have started to answer this. 

**Liu et al. (2025)** conducted an in-depth empirical study titled *“Quantization Hurts Reasoning? An Empirical Study on Quantized Reasoning Models.”*<d-cite key="QuantReasoning"></d-cite>  Their work systematically investigated how different levels of weight quantization affect the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving, scientific question answering, and code generation.

The study found that moderate quantization, such as using 8-bit or 4-bit weights, generally preserved model performance with minimal degradation. In fact, these settings were nearly lossless across most evaluated benchmarks, indicating that LLMs can tolerate some degree of compression without compromising reasoning accuracy.

However, the picture changes dramatically with more aggressive quantization. **When the bit-width was pushed down to 3-bit or lower, substantial accuracy drops were observed**, especially on tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. This suggests that LLMs—while robust to mild compression—are sensitive to extreme quantization, particularly in domains where subtle reasoning and logical consistency are critical.

These findings underscore a key limitation in using low-bit quantized models for reasoning-intensive applications: **quantization-induced fragility can lead to hallucination and significant performance degradation in reasoning.**

## Quantized Contrastive Decoding
Traditional contrastive decoding is powerful, but it hinges on having a weaker partner model. When an off-the-shelf “small sibling” isn’t available, we can manufacture one on the fly by **quantizing the expert itself**. Dropping the weights to under 4-bit precision reliably erodes a model’s reasoning ability while leaving its vocabulary and tensor shapes untouched—perfect for the contrastive objective.

As we mentioned in previous section, recent studies have measured this effect in detail: an 8-bit model stays almost on par with its full-precision parent, but under 4-bit variants start to miss multi-step inferences, struggle with long-range dependencies, and hallucinate more factual errors. In other words, **quantization delivers exactly the sort of “predictable clumsiness” we want from an amateur.** Better yet, it costs only a few minutes of post-processing and zero additional training.

With **QCD (Quantized Contrastive Decoding)**, we therefore get a complete contrastive pair from a single checkpoint:

1. **Expert** – the original, full-precision LLM.
2. **Amateur** – a weight-quantized clone that shares the same logits' vocaburary but makes poorer choices.

Because both networks live inside the same model family by construction, we sidestep vocabulary-mismatch headaches, avoid extra training for a second model. In practice this means: **take one model, quantize a copy, run two forward passes, apply contrastive scoring—done.** It’s a lightweight recipe that brings CD’s fluency-and-reasoning gains to any standalone model, without waiting for someone to release a matching “tiny” version.

## Experiment Setting

### Target Model & Baselines
We set Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as our target (expert) model and compared the following decoding strategies:
1.	**Greedy Decoding**
2.	**Contrastive Decoding (CD)**    
    : Contrastive decoding between Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (expert) and either Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct or 1B-Instruct (amateur)
3.	**Quantized Contrastive Decoding (QCD)**    
    : In QCD, we quantize Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct into 4-bit, 3-bit, and 2-bit models using AWQ<d-cite key="AWQ"></d-cite>. These quantized models are then used as the amateur models for contrastive decoding.

### Evaluation Dataset
For evaluation, we use standard QA benchmarks widely adopted in prior contrastive decoding papers:

1.	**TriviaQA** <d-cite key="TriviaQA"></d-cite>
2.	**Natural Questions (NQ)** <d-cite key="NQ"></d-cite>
3.	**StrategyQA** <d-cite key="StrategyQA"></d-cite>
4.	**TruthfulQA** <d-cite key="TruthfulQA"></d-cite>



### Hyperparameter
For the CD temperature—an important hyperparameter across CD-based methods—we perform a search in {0.01, 0.05, 0.1} and report the best score for each method. This tuning process is applied uniformly across all CD baselines.

First, we compare performance on TriviaQA and Natural Questions. TriviaQA and Natural Questions are both large-scale open-domain factual QA benchmarks that test a model’s grasp of broad, commonsense knowledge.  However, they differ in difficulty and style:
- TriviaQA Classic trivia QA—factoid questions that resemble pub-quiz prompts.
- Natural Questions (NQ) contains harder, real-world search queries pulled straight from Google logs.
In short, both datasets probe general knowledge, but NQ raises the bar with messier, search-style questions and trickier answer conditions, so strong gains on NQ usually indicate a more robust QA model.

The results show that contrastive decoding using a 1B/3B model as the amateur leads to improved performance over greedy decoding. This confirms that the effectiveness of contrastive decoding, as demonstrated in prior work, also holds within the LLaMA 3 family. Furthermore, our Quantized Contrastive Decoding (QCD) approach achieves comparable EM scores to CD with 1B/3B by generating the amateur model through 4-bit, 3-bit, or 2-bit AWQ quantization. This validates the idea that quantization can successfully produce a viable amateur model for CD.

The performance gap between CD with 1B/3B and QCD becomes more noticeable on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset. Both methods (except QCD with 3-bit) outperform greedy decoding in terms of EM and F1 scores. Notably, QCD-w2g64 and QCD-w4g64 achieve the best EM scores among all methods. Because NQ’s search-style questions and long, noisy evidence make it a more demanding test of open-domain QA ability, the fact that QCD delivers strong gains in this setting provides compelling evidence that our quantized assistant model enhances contrastive decoding not only on simple trivia, but also in more challenging, real-world scenarios.

StrategyQA is a small open-domain QA benchmark (≈ 3 k yes/no questions) whose items were written without showing passages and require chaining together several unstated facts; success therefore reflects an LLM’s ability to perform implicit, multi-hop reasoning rather than simple retrieval.

TruthfulQA is an open-ended generation benchmark that asks 817 deliberately tricky questions spread over 38 topic areas (health, history, science, the paranormal, and so on) in order to see whether a language model states the truth instead of repeating popular myths or hallucinating new falsehoods.
Each answer is evaluated on two binary dimensions: T (Truth), which is 1 if the response is factually correct and 0 otherwise, and I (Informativeness), which is 1 if the response contains at least one substantive piece of information and 0 if it is empty or “I don’t know.”  Because a useful answer must satisfy both conditions simultaneously, results are usually reported as the product T × I—an answer that is wrong or vacuous scores 0, while one that is both accurate and informative scores 1—yielding a single, stringent measure of hallucination-free generation. In TruthfulQA, we fixed the CD temperature to 1.0 across all methods—since this setting yielded the most prominent performance improvements—and compared the resulting scores.

Taken together with the earlier results—where QCD-w2g64 was the only method to beat greedy decoding on the harder factual sets (TriviaQA, Natural Questions) and on the reasoning-heavy StrategyQA—this shows that our two-bit, 64-group quantized assistant consistently improves generation quality across knowledge, reasoning, and hallucination-resistance alike.  In short, tuning the bit-width to create an “amateur” model whose noise profile best complements the expert is exactly what makes Quantized Contrastive Decoding so effective.



### Ablation - QCD with Different Group Size

As shown above, having an appropriately “weaker” assistant is key to effective contrastive decoding. In the context of quantization, we can control this by adjusting the group size, which allows us to trade off model simplicity and performance. So, in our experiments, we fixed the bit-width at 2 bits and explored the effect of varying the group size.

We compare greedy decoding with 2-bit AWQ quantized models using group sizes of 128, 64, 32, and 16, and visualize the results on TriviaQA, Natural Questions, and StrategyQA.

In the TriviaQA dataset, we observed that a group size of 16 significantly outperforms all other group sizes in both EM and F1 scores. However, the situation is completely reversed in the Natural Questions dataset. While all other group sizes surpass greedy decoding in both EM and F1, group size 16 is the only one that underperforms—falling short of even the baseline greedy decoding results.



## Conclusion

### Strength

1. **Eliminating Amateur Model Dependency & Reducing Memory Usage**  
  We propose a method for performing contrastive decoding (CD) without requiring a separate amateur model, by instead generating one through quantization. This addresses a key limitation of prior CD methods, which either required access to a smaller model from the same architecture family or needed to train a new one from scratch.
  Moreover, since our amateur model is simply a quantized version of the expert, it uses less VRAM during inference compared to alternatives like fine-tuned amateur models. As a result, our approach is not only more flexible but also more memory-efficient.

2. **Improved Generation Performance**  
  Past studies have shown that quantization often degrades reasoning ability. However, under QCD, we hypothesized that quantization could actually help improve generation quality by producing a well-calibrated contrastive signal.
  To test this, we conducted an extensive evaluation across multiple datasets with QCD. Consistently, we found that QCD improves performance over greedy decoding across all tasks—including factual QA, reasoning, and truthfulness benchmarks.
  This shows that QCD is not only effective at enhancing generation quality, but also generally applicable across diverse scenarios.

### Limitations

Despite the strengths of QCD outlined above, there are still several limitations worth discussing:

1. **Forward-Time Overhead in Contrastive Decoding**  
  QCD creates an amateur model through weight quantization and runs contrastive decoding by comparing the expert’s and amateur’s outputs. However, this setup inherently requires two forward passes per decoding step—one for the expert and one for the quantized amateur model.
  As a result, although QCD improves performance over greedy decoding, it comes at a cost: increased inference time and additional memory consumption to hold the quantized model. While more efficient than training a separate amateur, this extra overhead remains a key drawback relative to simpler decoding methods.

2. **Misaligned Objective of Quantization**  
  Our method uses AWQ, a quantization algorithm known for preserving accuracy even under extreme bit reductions. While this makes it a strong choice for maintaining model performance, it may not be ideal for generating contrastive signals, since a well-behaved quantized model might be too similar to the expert.
  In contrast, methods like ICD (Introspective Contrastive Decoding) deliberately fine-tune the amateur model to produce hallucinated or incorrect answers, thereby maximizing contrast during decoding. This suggests a future direction: if we can design quantization objectives that intentionally amplify hallucinations or inject specific kinds of noise into the quantized model, we may further enhance the effectiveness of QCD.
  In short, tuning the quantization process not just for compression but for contrastive utility could unlock even greater gains in generation quality.

3. **Choosing the Right Bit-width and Group Size**  
  In QCD, two key hyperparameters—quantization bit-width and group size—can be adjusted. Our experiments across multiple datasets revealed that the optimal bit and group size vary depending on the dataset. In other words, there is no single configuration that consistently performs best everywhere.
  To address this, and in line with the second limitation we previously discussed, a promising direction would be to design a quantization objective that is robust across bit-widths and group sizes. By tailoring the objective function, we could potentially create quantized assistant models that consistently enhance contrastive decoding performance in a generalizable way—without the need for dataset-specific tuning.
