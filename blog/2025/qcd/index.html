Traditional decoding strategies like greedy decoding select the highest-probability token at each step, which can result in highly degenerate behavior such as repetitive or overly concise text. On the other hand, probabilistic sampling (e.g., temperature sampling, top-k, or nucleus sampling) introduces randomness to improve diversity, but often at the cost of coherence and relevance. CD aims to combine the strengths of both while avoiding their weaknesses by leveraging two language models and optimizing a contrastive objective.</p> <ul> <li>Greedy decoding tends to produce repetitive and overly simple outputs by always selecting the highest-probability token.</li> <li>Sampling-based decoding introduces diversity by adding randomness but can result in incoherent or off-topic responses.</li> <li>Contrastive Decoding uses a large expert model and a smaller amateur model. It selects tokens that are favored by the expert model but not by the amateur model. This amplifies the expert’s strengths while suppressing undesirable patterns learned by the weaker model.</li> </ul> <p>The core idea behind CD is to exploit the difference in token likelihoods predicted by the two models. The score for a candidate token is calculated as:</p> \[\text{Score}(x) = \log P_{\text{expert}}(x \mid \text{context}) - \lambda \log P_{\text{amateur}}(x \mid \text{context})\] <p>Here, $P_{\text{expert}}$ is the probability from the expert model, $P_{\text{amateur}}$ is from the amateur model, and $\lambda$ is a CD temeperature that balances the penalization from the amateur model. This scoring mechanism favors tokens that are highly likely under the expert but unlikely under the amateur, indicating fluency and novelty.</p> <p>To prevent pathological cases (e.g., selecting implausible or noisy tokens), a plausibility constraint is applied. That is, only tokens whose expert likelihood exceeds a certain threshold are considered:</p> \[x \in \{ w \in \mathcal{V} \mid P_{\text{expert}}(w \mid \text{context}) \geq \alpha \cdot \max_{w'} P_{\text{expert}}(w' \mid \text{context}) \}\] <p>This ensures grammatical and contextual coherence.</p> <p>The authors highlighted the following advanteage:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Mitigation of Degenerate Outputs</strong>:<br> Traditional greedy decoding often results in repetitive or overly simplistic text, while sampling-based methods can produce incoherent outputs. CD effectively balances these issues by selecting tokens that are probable under the expert model but not under the amateur model, leading to more coherent and diverse text generation.</li> <li> <strong>Training-Free Implementation:</strong><br> CD operates without the need for additional training. It utilizes pre-existing models to compute the contrastive objective, making it computationally efficient and easy to integrate into existing systems.</li> <li> <strong>Enhanced Performance Across Tasks</strong>: <br> Empirical evaluations demonstrated that CD outperforms both greedy and sampling-based decoding methods across various benchmarks, including Wikipedia, news articles, and storytelling tasks. This indicates its robustness and versatility in different text generation scenarios.</li> <li> <strong>Scalability Across Model Sizes</strong>:<br> The method is effective across different scales of language models, from smaller models like GPT-2 to larger ones like OPT-13B. This scalability ensures that CD can be applied broadly, regardless of the underlying model size.</li> </ol> <p>Later studies shows that Contrastive Decoding not only improves generation quality but enhances reasoning ability. For example, O’Brien &amp; Lewis (2023)<d-cite key="CDReasoning"></d-cite> demonstrated that CD-enhanced LLaMA-65B outperformed larger models like GPT-3.5 and PaLM 2 on benchmarks such as HellaSwag and GSM8K. CD discourages superficial answers by penalizing shallow or obvious completions preferred by smaller models, encouraging deeper inference paths.</p> <h3 id="2-dependence-on-a-smaller-amateur-model">2. Dependence on a Smaller “Amateur” Model</h3> <p>Contrastive Decoding relies fundamentally on having two different LMs:<br> <strong>a strong expert</strong> and <strong>a weaker amateur</strong>.<br> If we attempted to use the same model for both roles, the contrastive objective would trivially cancel out (since $\log P_{\rm expert}(w)=\log P_{\rm amateur}(w)$ for every token $w$). <br> Concretely, the CD score for a sequence $\mathbf{x}$ is</p> \[S(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{t=1}^T \left[ \log P_{\mathrm{expert}}(x_t \mid x_{\lt t}) - \lambda \log P_{\mathrm{amateur}}(x_t \mid x_{\lt t}) \right]\] <p>If $P_{\rm expert}=P_{\rm amateur}$, then $S(\mathbf{x})=(1-\lambda)\sum_{t=1}^T\Bigl[\log P_{\rm expert}(x_t \mid x_{\lt t})\Bigl]=(1-\lambda)\sum_{t=1}^T\Bigl[\log P_{\rm amateur}(x_t \mid x_{\lt t}) \Bigr]$ for all $\mathbf{x}$, which is same with greedy decoding. More importantly, however, the need for a separate amateur model goes beyond this triviality: <strong>a distinct, weaker model produces a systematically different probability distribution that highlights undesirable patterns.</strong></p> <p>In practice, a small language model (the amateur) tends to place much higher probability on degenerate tokens (e.g. repetitions or off-topic phrases) than the expert does. Indeed, <strong>“many failure modes of language models (short, repetitive, irrelevant or uninteresting strings) are more common under smaller LMs than under larger LMs”.</strong> For example, if both models consider repeating the same noun (“Hawaii Hawaii …”), the small model will usually be overconfident in that repetition, while the large model assigns some probability to other alternatives. In terms of the contrastive score, such a token $w$ has $\log P_{\rm amateur}(w)\gg \log P_{\rm expert}(w)$, so $S$ becomes strongly negative, effectively penalizing $w$. In this way the amateur’s “mistakes” serve as negative signals: tokens it favors are deemed undesirable and are downweighted in generation. Conversely, desirable continuations that the expert favors (e.g. factual or novel content) but that the amateur underestimates will receive a higher contrastive score.</p> <p>Mathematically, one can view the contrast as emphasizing the ratio $P_{\rm expert}/P_{\rm amateur}$. When the two distributions diverge on certain tokens, the contrastive term $\log\frac{P_{\rm expert}(w)}{P_{\rm amateur}(w)}$ will be large (positive or negative) and guide selection. If the distributions are nearly identical, there is no such guidance. Crucially, we want the amateur’s distribution to differ in exactly the right ways: it should magnify the expert’s failure modes. Empirically, pairing a large expert with a much smaller amateur (e.g.\ OPT-13B expert with OPT-125M amateur) yields much higher-quality text. By contrast, using an identical model produces highly repetitive outputs because no contrast can be exploited. Even using a stronger amateur than expert or a trivial model (like a 3-gram LM) fails: the former flips the desired direction, and the latter makes errors that do not align with the expert’s weaknesses.</p> <p>In summary, a separate weaker model is essential not only to avoid the obvious cancelation of the contrastive term, but more importantly to induce a distributional gap. The amateur’s sharper biases toward repetition and incoherence highlight those patterns as negative examples. Contrastive Decoding then effectively “filters out” any token that the amateur model overvalues, leaving the fluent, coherent continuations that the large expert model uniquely prefers. This asymmetric design — expert versus a weaker, differently trained model — is what makes the contrastive objective meaningful and powerful in practie.</p> <h2 id="workarounds-when-no-amateur-model-is-available">Workarounds When No Amateur Model Is Available</h2> <p>In practice, we may not always have a smaller “amateur” model on hand for contrastive decoding. One notable approach is Induce-then-Contrast Decoding (ICD)<d-cite key="ICD"></d-cite>,which turns the original LLM into both the expert and the amateur in a two-phase process . The idea is to induce the big model to produce hallucinations (thereby acting like a factually deficient model) and then contrast those hallucinated outputs against the normal model’s outputs. This effectively penalizes content that looks like the model’s known hallucinations, guiding the decoder towards more truthful results.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/qcd/icd-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/qcd/icd-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/qcd/icd-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/qcd/icd.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 w-50 mx-auto d-block" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Illustration of Induce-then-Contrast Decoding (ICD) method for reducing hallucinations in LLMs. </div> <p><strong>How does the model hallucinate on purpose?</strong></p> <p>The authors of ICD construct a <em>factuality-weak</em> version of the LLM – essentially an “evil twin” that has a higher tendency to fabricate information. One of the methods the authors chose was to <strong>create an “evil-twin” model by fine-tuning the original LLM on False Dataset</strong>. For the strongest effect, one can fine-tune a copy of the model on a small, synthetic dataset of factual errors. In the ICD paper, the authors automatically generated non-factual QA examples (e.g. altering a correct fact “ACL 2024 will be held in Bangkok” into a false version “ACL 2024 will be held in Singapore”) and fine-tuned the LLM on these hallucination-style responses . This induced-hallucination model serves as a robust amateur that consistently produces fluent yet incorrect outputs.</p> <p>Once we have the original model and an induced-hallucination version with fine-tuning, we perform <strong>contrastive decoding between them at each step</strong>. This contrastive re-weighting steers the final choice away from content the model’s “weak alter-ego” would say, thereby filtering out potential fabrications without needing an external smaller network.</p> <p>Crucially, this induced contrast method maintains the benefits of using a powerful LLM while creating an internal check against its own flaws. The results reported for ICD are impressive: across multiple benchmarks, <strong>a single 7B model using ICD can match or even surpass the factuality of models that are 10× larger</strong>. This highlights that a carefully induced amateur can be far more informative than a generic smaller model. The contrast signal is directly tuned to the kinds of mistakes the expert would otherwise make, so it catches factual errors that might slip past an unrelated weaker model.</p> <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p> <p>While this induce-and-contrast method can markedly improve factual accuracy, it carries <strong>substantial overhead on two fronts</strong>. First, inference now needs <strong>two forward passes</strong> instead of one, roughly doubling per-token compute (the authors report ≈1.6 × latency). The most important and crucial limitation of ICD is <strong>that you must actually create the hallucination-prone “evil-twin” model via a separate fine-tuning step.</strong> Even with lightweight adapters such as LoRA, this demands extra GPU hours, synthetic data generation, additional checkpoints to store, and a parallel deployment path to maintain. In short, Induce-then-Contrast is a powerful stop-gap when no pre-trained amateur model exists—it lets you bake one from scratch—but it is <strong>anything but a free lunch</strong> in engineering effort, training time, and runtime cost.</p> <h2 id="quantization-of-llms">Quantization of LLMs</h2> <p>Before diving into main section of this blog post, let’s briefly recap model quantization. <strong>Quantization</strong> means compressing a neural network by using fewer bits to represent weights (and sometimes activations), thereby drastically reducing memory and speeding up inference . Modern LLMs often use 16-bit or 32-bit floats; quantization can shrink them to 8-bit or even 4-bit integers. The big question is: <em>how does quantization affect an LLM’s performance, especially on reasoning tasks?</em> Recent empirical studies have started to answer this.</p> <p><strong>Liu et al. (2025)</strong> conducted an in-depth empirical study titled <em>“Quantization Hurts Reasoning? An Empirical Study on Quantized Reasoning Models.”</em><d-cite key="QuantReasoning"></d-cite> Their work systematically investigated how different levels of weight quantization affect the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving, scientific question answering, and code generation.</p> <p>The study found that moderate quantization, such as using 8-bit or 4-bit weights, generally preserved model performance with minimal degradation. In fact, these settings were nearly lossless across most evaluated benchmarks, indicating that LLMs can tolerate some degree of compression without compromising reasoning accuracy.</p> <p>However, the picture changes dramatically with more aggressive quantization. <strong>When the bit-width was pushed down to 3-bit or lower, substantial accuracy drops were observed</strong>, especially on tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. This suggests that LLMs—while robust to mild compression—are sensitive to extreme quantization, particularly in domains where subtle reasoning and logical consistency are critical.</p> <p>These findings underscore a key limitation in using low-bit quantized models for reasoning-intensive applications: <strong>quantization-induced fragility can lead to hallucination and significant performance degradation in reasoning.</strong></p> <table> <colgroup> <col style="width: 30%;"> <col style="width: 17%;" span="4"> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th rowspan="1" style="text-align:center;">Llama 3.1 8B Instruct</th> <th colspan="1" style="text-align:center;">FP16</th> <th colspan="1" style="text-align:center;">W4G64</th> <th colspan="1" style="text-align:center;">W3G64</th> <th colspan="1" style="text-align:center;">W2G16</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align:center;">Truthfulness</td> <td style="text-align:center;">0.889</td> <td style="text-align:center;">0.892</td> <td style="text-align:center;">0.805</td> <td style="text-align:center;">0.627</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:center;">TruthfulQA_mc2</td> <td style="text-align:center;">54.1</td> <td style="text-align:center;">50.9</td> <td style="text-align:center;">49.3</td> <td style="text-align:center;">46.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:center;">Arc_challenge (Reasoning)</td> <td style="text-align:center;">55.1</td> <td style="text-align:center;">53.8</td> <td style="text-align:center;">48.6</td> <td style="text-align:center;">36.9</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="caption"> Preliminary experiment : can we use quantized models as amateur in CD? </div> <h2 id="quantized-contrastive-decoding">Quantized Contrastive Decoding</h2> <p>Traditional contrastive decoding is powerful, but it hinges on having a weaker partner model. When an off-the-shelf “small sibling” isn’t available, we can manufacture one on the fly by <strong>quantizing the expert itself</strong>. Dropping the weights to under 4-bit precision reliably erodes a model’s reasoning ability while leaving its vocabulary and tensor shapes untouched—perfect for the contrastive objective.</p> <p>As we mentioned in previous section, recent studies have measured this effect in detail: an 8-bit model stays almost on par with its full-precision parent, but under 4-bit variants start to miss multi-step inferences, struggle with long-range dependencies, and hallucinate more factual errors. In other words, <strong>quantization delivers exactly the sort of “predictable clumsiness” we want from an amateur.</strong> Better yet, it costs only a few minutes of post-processing and zero additional training.</p> <p>With <strong>QCD (Quantized Contrastive Decoding)</strong>, we therefore get a complete contrastive pair from a single checkpoint:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Expert</strong> – the original, full-precision LLM.</li> <li> <strong>Amateur</strong> – a weight-quantized clone that shares the same logits’ vocaburary but makes poorer choices.</li> </ol> <p>Because both networks live inside the same model family by construction, we sidestep vocabulary-mismatch headaches, avoid extra training for a second model. In practice this means: <strong>take one model, quantize a copy, run two forward passes, apply contrastive scoring—done.</strong> It’s a lightweight recipe that brings CD’s fluency-and-reasoning gains to any standalone model, without waiting for someone to release a matching “tiny” version.</p> <h2 id="experiment-setting">Experiment Setting</h2> <h3 id="target-model--baselines">Target Model &amp; Baselines</h3> <p>We set Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as our target (expert) model and compared the following decoding strategies:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Greedy Decoding</strong></li> <li> <dl> <dt><strong>Contrastive Decoding (CD)</strong></dt> <dd>Contrastive decoding between Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (expert) and either Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct or 1B-Instruct (amateur)</dd> </dl> </li> <li> <dl> <dt><strong>Quantized Contrastive Decoding (QCD)</strong></dt> <dd>In QCD, we quantize Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct into 4-bit, 3-bit, and 2-bit models using AWQ<d-cite key="AWQ"></d-cite>.

TriviaQA and Natural Questions are both large-scale open-domain factual QA benchmarks that test a model’s grasp of broad, commonsense knowledge. However, they differ in difficulty and style:</p> <ul> <li>TriviaQA Classic trivia QA—factoid questions that resemble pub-quiz prompts.</li> <li>Natural Questions (NQ) contains harder, real-world search queries pulled straight from Google logs. In short, both datasets probe general knowledge, but NQ raises the bar with messier, search-style questions and trickier answer conditions, so strong gains on NQ usually indicate a more robust QA model.</li> </ul> <p>On TriviaQA, the results show that contrastive decoding using a 1B/3B model as the amateur slightly outperforms greedy decoding. This confirms that the effectiveness of contrastive decoding, as demonstrated in prior work, also holds within the LLaMA 3 family. Furthermore, our Quantized Contrastive Decoding (QCD) approach achieves comparable EM scores to CD with 1B/3B by generating the amateur model through 4-bit, 3-bit, or 2-bit AWQ quantization. This validates the idea that quantization can successfully produce a viable amateur model for CD.</p> <p>On NQ dataset, we observed particularly strong results that highlight the effectiveness and advantages of QCD. While contrastive decoding with 1B/3B models showed degraded performance, QCD 3/2-bit outperformed greedy decoding in both EM and F1 scores. Notably, QCD 3-bit achieved the highest EM score among all methods. Since NQ involves search-style questions and long, noisy evidence, it presents a more challenging test of open-domain QA ability. The fact that QCD delivers significant performance gains in NQ provides strong evidence that a quantized amateur model can enhance contrastive decoding not only on simple trivia, but also in more challenging, real-world scenarios.</p> <p>An interesting observaion here is that amateur models with significant hallucination damage may actually be more effective for contrastive decoding than those less damage. This is supported by the fact that the QCD 2-bit perform best on TriviaQA and QCD 3-bit on NQ, while the least damaged 4-bit models perform pooly.</p> <h3 id="case-study">Case Study</h3> <p>We evaluated the hallucination mitigation effect of QCD on tasks such as TriviaQA and Natural Questions. The results include cases where the model fails due to hallucination, as well as cases where the model lacks sufficient knowledge to answer the question correctly.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-start"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/qcd/case_nonhallucination-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/qcd/case_nonhallucination-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/qcd/case_nonhallucination-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/qcd/case_nonhallucination.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 w-80 d-block" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Probability Distribution of QCD for samples of non-hallucination case. </div> <p>In the figure above, the first token of the golden answer, “Sam,” does not appear among the top predicted tokens of the expert model.

To more accurately evaluate the hallucination mitigation effect, we analyzed how each Q-amateur model actually influences the expert model’s decision-making. We classified the impact into two categories: (1) Positive Effect and (2) Negative Effect, and conducted a detailed analysis based on this classification.</p> <ul> <li>Case 1 Positive Effect: Wrong Prediction in Greedy Decoding &amp; Correct with CD</li> </ul> <div class="row row-cols-1 mt-3"> <div class="col text-start"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/qcd/case1_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/qcd/case1_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/qcd/case1_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/qcd/case1_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 w-80 d-block" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col text-start"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/qcd/case1_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/qcd/case1_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/qcd/case1_2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/qcd/case1_2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 w-80 d-block" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Probability Distribution of QCD for samples of Case 1: Positive Effect. </div> <p>The examples above show cases where the expert initially made an incorrect prediction, but the correct answer was retrieved through QCD.

In TriviaQA, the 2-bit model performs better, while in Natural Questions, the 3-bit model is preferred. On the other hand, the 4-bit model, which shows scores of –4 and –1 respectively for each dataset, appears to offer little to no benefit from CD, and in fact may even lead to worse outcomes.</li> <li>Case 1 + Case 2: This value reflects the degree to which CD influences the expert model’s decision. As seen in the earlier examples, the 2-bit model exhibits a distribution that significantly diverges from the expert, thereby introducing substantial variation in predictions. In contrast, the 4-bit model shows less than half the value of the 2-bit model, indicating that it preserves the expert’s performance more faithfully. As a result, its predictions remain similar to the expert’s, and CD rarely alters the final decision.</li> </ol> <p>Through this quantitative and qualitative analysis, we find empirical evidence suggesting that lower-bit quantized models may be more suitable for CD, and we assess the potential of contrastive decoding using Q-amateur models.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <h3 id="strength">Strength</h3> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Eliminating Amateur Model Dependency and Improving Memory Efficiency</strong><br> In this work, we propose Quantized Contrastive Decoding (QCD), a method that eliminates the need for a separate amateur model in Contrastive Decoding (CD) by quantizing the expert model itself. This approach removes the burden of locating a smaller model from the same architecture family or training a new one from scratch. Moreover, since the quantized amateur is derived directly from the expert, it significantly reduces VRAM usage during inference compared to fine-tuned or separately trained amateur models.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Practical and Generalizable Performance Gains</strong><br> While prior studies suggest that quantization leads to performance degradation, our findings show that this degradation can be repurposed as a useful contrastive signal in the context of CD. In factual QA dataset, QCD consistently outperforms greedy decoding. These results highlight QCD’s ability to enhance generation quality, suggesting that the quantization-induced degradation is not merely a drawback but a meaningful source of contrastive information. This insight opens up new avenues for research at the intersection of model compression and decoding strategies, and indicates that further exploration of quantization-aware contrastive decoding holds significant potential for improving the efficiency and performance of large language models.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3> <p>Despite the strengths of QCD outlined above, there are still several limitations worth discussing:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Inference Overhead in Time and Memory</strong><br> QCD requires two forward passes per decoding step—one for the expert and one for the quantized amateur. This leads to higher inference latency and increased memory consumption compared to standard single-model decoding methods. While more efficient than training a separate amateur, this overhead can still be a barrier in latency-sensitive applications.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Quantization Objectives Misaligned with CD Needs</strong><br> Existing quantization techniques are primarily designed to minimize performance loss relative to the original model. However, Contrastive Decoding (CD) requires the opposite: an amateur model that diverges meaningfully from the expert, particularly by exhibiting degraded reasoning and increased hallucination. This fundamental mismatch limits the effectiveness of QCD, as quantized models optimized for accuracy preservation may remain too similar to the expert, weakening the contrastive signal. To fully realize the potential of QCD, future work should explore CD-specific quantization objectives that intentionally induce divergence. This may include incorporating divergence-aware metrics such as KL divergence, mutual information, or semantic distortion losses into the quantization process, allowing the generation of hallucination-prone yet syntactically fluent amateur models.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Bit-width and Group Size</strong><br> QCD performance is sensitive to quantization hyperparameters—namely bit-width and group size. Our experiments reveal that the optimal settings differ across datasets, and no universal configuration exists. This sensitivity imposes a practical burden on tuning and limits the generalizability of QCD in real-world applications where extensive per-task calibration is infeasible.</p> </li> </ol> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/qcd.bib"></d-bibliography> <div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 930px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>
